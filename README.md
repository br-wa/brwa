# brwa
The style package that I use. Note that it is intended that there are a lot of options that can be passed---a full documentation will come soon. Relatedly, this should be fully customizable--you can replace brwabase.sty and brwabox.sty with your preferred .sty's as desired. 

Furthermore, please command with **LuaLaTeX** or **XeTeX**, not pdfLaTeX. I personally use ```latexmk -pdflatex='lualatex' -pdf [tex document]```
